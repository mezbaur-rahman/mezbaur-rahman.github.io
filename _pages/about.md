I am Mezbaur Rahman, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC), where I work as a Research Assistant in the dl4nlpspace Lab under the guidance of Professor <a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/~cornelia/" target="_blank">Cornelia Caragea</a>. My research lies at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, with a focus on semi-supervised learning and learning from noisy labels using signals from large language models (LLMs).

I earned my B.Sc. in <a href="https://cse.iutoic-dhaka.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science and Engineering</a> from the <a href="https://iutoic-dhaka.edu/" target="_blank">Islamic University of technology (IUT)</a>, Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2019. After graduation, I joined IUT as a Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, where I taught undergraduate courses and engaged in research until July 2023. In Fall 2023, I began my Ph.D. journey at UIC, where I am currently pursuing my doctoral studies in Computer Science.
